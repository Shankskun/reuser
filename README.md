### The Premise

##### The Issue

Too many reusable goods are disposed of to landfill because there exist few efficient systems for the redistribution of goods from those disposing of them to those who might make use of them. The average Australian generates approximately 2,000 kilograms of waste every year; one third of which is food waste. This is a problem that impacts all of us as we live in a world of limited resources too many of which we consume and discard before they are fully utilised. We are taught to reduce, reuse, and recycle, but when it comes to reusing the current facilities we have at our disposal are inadequate.

We can put used items out for hard rubbish collection but not all goods are accepted and there are no guidelines for what is done with them so they often end up in landfill. We can donate used items to charity shops but there is no easy way to browse these items without going to the physical store. We can give the items away on listing sites such as Gumtree but these are generally for-profit companies where free listing get lost in a sea of products for sale. On top of these limitations none of these approaches facilitate the redistribution of perishable goods such as food or building materials.

Most consumers care about preserving the environment but are too often forced to dispense with still useful goods simple because they lack an avenue for getting these goods to other people who can further utilise them.


##### The Solution

reUser is a platform intended to connect givers with reusers. It is a map based listing platform (based on the Google Maps API) which allows givers to advertise goods they wish to give away instead of discarding. Goods can be listed in a variety of categories including traditional ones (e.g. electronics and furniture) and ones often neglected by other facilities such as groceries and building materials.

The ultimate goal of reUser is to maximise the lifespan and utility of goods neglected by other facilities by getting them to people who can make use of them thereby reducing the environmental impact of excess consumption.
